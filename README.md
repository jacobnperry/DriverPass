# DriverPass


    Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
    The DriverPass team was looking to implement a student driver web app.  The site will focus on providing a resource portal to learn and practice driving.
    What did you do particularly well?
    The UML diagrams I created for this proect felt especially well thought out and cogent to the project.  All of the different types of diagrams served a critical purpose througout the project, helping to highlight the critical components.
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    I focused on the importance of keeping the site up with minimal maintenance.  Based upon the clients needs that were expressed in the interview, having the site up at all times allowing the students to access the materials needed to help pass their driving test at any time.  This was why I settled on suggesting their use of a cloud based server service such as AWS.
    How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
    If the idea is able to be hosted on a cloud server that is what I would recommend most times.  Removing the cost, space, power, and labor to maintain and keep servers up at all times can be removed by utilizing a cloud based system.
